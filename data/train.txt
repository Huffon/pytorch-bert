Alice, turn that off now, please.
Why? It's almost over.
Now, please. Just turn that off.
They're finding out who did it, and the WiFi sucks in my room...
Turn it off now! Alice! Off!
There isn't even anything bad on it, it's just normal TV...
They're talking murder on it!
Alice, you can keep watching your show, it's fine.
I'm sorry Marta.
It's okay.
